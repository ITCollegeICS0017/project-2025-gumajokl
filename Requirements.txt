Variant 2. Currency Exchange
The process of exchanging money at a currency exchange point is as follows: a client asks
the cashier about converting a certain amount of money from one currency to another. The
cashier checks whether there is sufficient reserve of the requested currency and informs the
client about the possibility of the transaction. If the exchange is performed, a receipt is
issued, indicating the currencies, exchange rate, amount, and date of the transaction. At the
clientâ€™s request, money can be issued in specific denominations or partially exchanged (e.g.,
exchanging 100 units for 50 units and the rest in local currency). At the end of the workday,
the cashier prepares a summary report with the starting and ending balances of each
currency, as well as the profit earned, and submits it to management. If a currency reserve
falls below the critical minimum, the cashier informs management. Management sets
exchange rates, maintains reserves, and awards the cashier a monthly bonus of 5% of the
profit.
